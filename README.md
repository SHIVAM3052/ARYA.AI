**Binary Classification**

**1. Dataset contain 2 CSV file.**
1.1 Training CSV file : Consist of 57 features and Y as label in (0/1)
1.2 Test CSV file : Consist of 57 features only 


**2. Data visualisation using t-sne  **

In the above t-sne graph, we can visualize feature distributions of all data points.
2.1 Use feature engineering method to remove overlap features but it didn't work out.
2.2 K-NN and SVM model able to give less accuracy due to clusters overlapping
